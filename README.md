# ResNet50 and VGG16 Based System for Analyzing Deforestation Patterns Using Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning

This project provides a precise and efficient method for detecting and analyzing deforestation patterns using advanced deep learning models and feature fusion techniques.  

The system preprocesses satellite images using methods such as normalization, cropping, rotation, and scaling to enhance data quality and model performance. Two state-of-the-art deep learning models are employed:  

1. **ResNet50 Architecture**: A deep residual network designed to capture fine-grained features from high-resolution satellite images, enabling accurate identification of deforestation patterns.  
2. **VGG16 Pretrained Model**: Fine-tuned for satellite imagery, this model enhances classification accuracy through its deep convolutional layers and hierarchical feature extraction.  

Features extracted from both models are fused to provide a comprehensive representation of deforestation patterns. These multimodal features are then classified using machine learning techniques like Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, achieving high accuracy in deforestation detection and classification.  

This system offers a powerful tool for monitoring environmental changes and enabling effective forest management.
